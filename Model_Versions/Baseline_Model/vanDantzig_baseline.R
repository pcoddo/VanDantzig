###################################################

### Case 1: Perform economic analysis without uncertainty

# Optimal dike heightening, X (equation 6 in paper), analytical solution:
C = (100 * p_zero_p * V_p * alpha_p) / ((delta_prime_p * 100-beta_p) * k_p) *
    (1 - exp(-(delta_prime_p * 100-beta_p) * T/100)) / 
    (1 - exp(-delta_prime_p * 100 * T / 100));

X_analytical = 1/alpha_p * log(C)

# New dike height without uncertainty:
  print(X_analytical + H_0)



### Case 2: Numerical Analysis with uncertainty

# Range of considered dike height increases (meters)
X = seq(0, 10, by=0.05)

# Time horizon in annual increments
time = seq(0, T, by=1)

# Define variables and intialize with NA values
p_exceed                   = array(NA, dim=c(length(X)))
costs                      = array(NA, dim=c(length(X)))
NPV_expected_losses        = array(NA, dim=c(length(X)))
EV_p_exceed_transient      = array(NA, dim=c(length(X)))
Total_flood_frequency      = array(NA, dim=c(length(X)))
total_costs                = array(NA, dim=c(length(X)))

discount_factor            = array(NA, dim=c(length(time)))

NPV_costs_flooding         = array(NA, dim=c(length(X), length(time)))

subsidence                 = subs_rate * time
sea_level_rise             = sea_level_rate * time

# Analyze for each considered Deike heightening 
# Loop over each dike height (X), and for each year in time horizon

  	  discount_factor[j] = 1/(1+delta_prime_p)^year
  
  	  # The effective dike height is the current height minus the 
  	  # combined effects of land subsidence and sea-level rise
  	  effective_height[i,j] = X[i]-subsidence[j]-sea_level_rise[j]
  
  	  # Annual flood frequency using old observations and new effective height 
  	  # (assumes stationary flooding frequency)
  	  p_exceed_transient[i,j] = p_zero_p*exp(-alpha_p*effective_height[i,j])
  
  	  #The net present value of the losses per year are the product of the
  	  #frequency of flooding per year, the damages per flood, and the discount factor.
  	  NPV_costs_flooding[i,j] = p_exceed_transient[i,j]*V_p*discount_factor[j]
      }

  # The costs of flood protection (dike building) - increase linearly with respect to height
  costs[i] = k_p*X[i]

  # The total discounted expected losses are the sum of the discounted expected annual losses
  NPV_expected_losses[i] = sum(NPV_costs_flooding[i,])
   
  # Expected value of average annual flood frequency (mean of annual flood frequencies)
  EV_p_exceed_transient[i] = mean(p_exceed_transient[i,])

  # The total flood frequency over the life-time of the project is the sum of the flood frequencies,
  # assuming independence, as in the original paper
  Total_flood_frequency[i] = sum(p_exceed_transient[i,])

  # The total costs that depend on the dike height. This analysis neglects initial mobilization 
  # costs (I_0) in paper, as well as any costs extending beyond considered time horizon
  total_costs[i] = costs[i]+NPV_expected_losses[i]
